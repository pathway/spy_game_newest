Present day.
It's 1997 it's been 2 years since you lost all your money. You wake up at 7:00am, thinking how to get your money back, due to huge press no one is hiring you for movies the only thing you're thinking of is how to get back on your feet.

you go for a walk thinking what to do, the first thing that comes to your mind is to get a new job but who wants to hire you?... you go buy some food, you buy: milk, bread, cheese, butter, soda, and some cookies. you tread back home but suddenly you bump into someone, it's a blond woman with long flowing hair she turned around and hands you a white card, you say what is this and who are you? she responds, it's a job, you interested? you take the card and look at it, the first thing it says is, go to a closed area and read the back... you look confused, and then you go home.

You get home and you look at the card, you go to the bathroom and you close everything the door, windows, you sit on the toilet and you look nervous, you look at the back and it says: a phone number: 702 007 2415... suddenly your phone starts ringing when you pick it up you hear the woman you met say staticly: stop the bomb... stop the spunnge. meet me at the casino... you flinch, you put on your jacket and you get out of the apartment and you lock it and then you're on your way...
